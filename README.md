# World_Food_Production

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the climate change effect of crop production. The crops in the analysis include Maize, Rice, and Wheat. Tracking Co2 levels from 101 Countries. We will create a database with multiple tables and finally an SQL view to use in our reporting.

# Sources
Software: Microsoft Power BI Desktop 2.92.1067.0 64-bit, Microsoft SQL Server 2016 - 13.0.5102.14 (X64) Microsoft Corporation Developer Edition (64-bit) 
Data : CO2_Data.csv, Maize_Production.csv, Maize_Yields.csv, Rice_Production.csv, Rice_Yields.csv, Surface_Temperature_Anomaly.csv, Wheat_Production.csv, Wheat_Yields.csv

# Summary
The results are summarized in a [Microsoft PowerBI Report](https://github.com/Donik22/World_Food_Production/blob/main/WorldFoodProductionBI.pbix). Filter through the countries slicer to get a more specific chart.

# Conclusion
From the data we collected it is clear that temperature increased in direct proportion to Co2 levels globally. The country most affected by This increase in tempreature is  `Angola `, `Canada` and  `Afghanistan` In that order. The countries that contributed the most to global Co2 level increase are `china`, `The United States` and `Russia` In that order. Therefore Increased CO2 Levels are felt outsides the borders of the biggest contributors.  Crop Production is still increasing but compared to the population increase it is not in a Good trajectory.
